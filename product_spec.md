Product Specification Document: AI-Powered Parkour Coaching App
1. Overview
AI-Powered Parkour Coaching App is designed to enhance the coaching experience, providing tools for reflective practice, curriculum planning, AI-assisted insights, and a parkour knowledge base. The app is not a student training tracker but a coach-focused assistant, helping coaches refine their methods, reduce burnout, and streamline lesson planning while maintaining the core principles of parkour. The app is designed with ADAPT coaching principles in mind and seeks to honor and evangelize the values of structured, reflective coaching within the parkour discipline.


2. Proof of Concept (PoC)
Purpose & Value:
The PoC is designed to validate AI’s ability to enhance parkour coaching by demonstrating how it can reduce administrative overhead, improve reflection, and assist in session planning. This phase ensures that AI-generated insights are useful and intuitive before expanding to a broader feature set. The PoC serves as a testbed to determine whether AI-driven coaching support is valuable and practical for ADAPT-trained coaches.
Objective:
Prove that AI can provide meaningful value to ADAPT coaches by reducing administrative overhead, improving reflective coaching practices, and assisting in curriculum development.
Key Features for PoC:
AI-Assisted Coaching Reflections – AI helps coaches analyze their session notes and provides insights to improve their practice.
AI-Generated Session Plans – AI suggests structured training sessions based on a coach’s past reflections and ADAPT methodologies.
Simple Onboarding Experience – Introduces core ADAPT-aligned parkour coaching philosophies in a lightweight way.
Success Criteria for PoC:
AI reduces the time coaches spend on lesson planning and administrative tasks.
AI-generated insights help coaches refine their teaching methods and improve session quality.
At least 10 real coaches actively engage with AI-assisted reflections and session planning.
